This repository contains the modification on the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering", which can be found [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/)

This repository uses ViT-S/8 DINO pretrained model. Model code can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino) and ViT-S/8 pretrained DINO weights can be downloaded from this [link](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/dino_deitsmall8_pretrain/dino_deitsmall8_pretrain.pth).
