This repository contains the modification on the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering", which can be found [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/)

# DINO Code and Pretrained Model
This repository uses a ViT-S/8 DINO pretrained model. Model code (including vision_transformer.py and visualize_dino.py that we slightly modified) can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino) and the ViT-S/8 pretrained DINO weights can be downloaded from this [link](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/dino_deitsmall8_pretrain/dino_deitsmall8_pretrain.pth).

# Data Sets
The datasets used for experiments are the following. 
- Mip-NeRF 360 Scenes taken from the [link](http://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/refraw360/360_v2.zip) provided by the original Mip-NeRF 360 [webpage](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/)
- Tanks&Temples Truck and Train Scenes and Deep Blending Playroom and Dr. Johnson Scenes downloaded from this [link](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip) provided by the original 3D Gaussian splatting [github repo](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting)
- Synthetic NeRF Scenes taken from this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1) provided by the [original NeRF github repo](https://github.com/bmild/nerf)
